# custom-raylib-toolbar-bzw.-titlebar
I got tired of my incapeablity to change the icon of the main raylib window, so I removed the entire bar and made my own custom one, with extra functionality

  
#  Functionality
- Display FPS
- Always On Top (cannot be turned off, trust me, its a feature)
- pause/resume
- Take Screenshots
- Custom Curser
- Minimize
- Fullscreen
- exit
- All Of The Above In A Handy Right-Click-Menu
- Window can be moved across the screen (at the height of the icons; simply left click and move around)
- Curser is hidden after a second of inactivity 


# Note
   I Forgot to Deinitialize and I do not know how to efficiently unload 70ish ressources; The program won't have Deinitlilisation or proper spelling in its readme
