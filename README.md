# custom-raylib-toolbar-bzw.-titlebar
I got tired of my incapeablity to change the icon of the main raylib window, so I removed the entire bar and made my own custom one, with extra functionality

  
#  Functionality
- Display FPS
- Always On Top (cannot be turned off, trust me, its a feature)
- pause/resume
- Take Screenshots
- Custom Curser
- Minimize
- Fullscreen
- exit
- All Of The Above In A Handy Right-Click-Menu
